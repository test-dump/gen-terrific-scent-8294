Afterwards, we can retrieve the string to use for our test assertion.\n\nHere are the tests you need to write: \n- Create a StringWriter to redirect the console output. \n- Use Assert to check if the console output matches \"Hello, World!\".\n\nFor example:\n- The \"HelloWorldOutputTest\" test case checks if the program prints \"Hello, World!\".\n\nHere's the implementation for the \"HelloWorldOutputTest\" test case:\n\nProgramTest.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing Xunit;\n\npublic class ProgramTest\n{\n    [Fact]\n    public void HelloWorldOutputTest()\n    {\n        var sw = new StringWriter();\n        Console.SetOut(sw);\n        Program.Main(new string[0]);\n\n        var result = sw.ToString().Trim();\n        Assert.Equal(\"Hello, World!\", result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis Xunit test checks that the console output of the main program is exactly \"Hello, World!\" when the program is run. The output stream of the console is temporarily redirected to a StringWriter object so that we can get and test the output of the console.\n\nThe \".Trim()\" is used to remove any trailing newline characters which Console.WriteLine() appends to the string. If this is not removed, our test case would fail since \"Hello, World! \" is not equal to \"Hello, World!\". \n\nOn start, the main program should execute and print \"Hello, World!\" on the console. The Xunit test captures this console output and checks if it is as expected."}]
