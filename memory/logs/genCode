Afterwards, we can retrieve the string to use for our test assertion.\n\nHere are the tests you need to write: \n- Create a StringWriter to redirect the console output. \n- Use Assert to check if the console output matches \"Hello, World!\".\n\nFor example:\n- The \"HelloWorldOutputTest\" test case checks if the program prints \"Hello, World!\".\n\nHere's the implementation for the \"HelloWorldOutputTest\" test case:\n\nProgramTest.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing Xunit;\n\npublic class ProgramTest\n{\n    [Fact]\n    public void HelloWorldOutputTest()\n    {\n        var sw = new StringWriter();\n        Console.SetOut(sw);\n        Program.Main(new string[0]);\n\n        var result = sw.ToString().Trim();\n        Assert.Equal(\"Hello, World!\", result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis Xunit test checks that the console output of the main program is exactly \"Hello, World!\" when the program is run. The output stream of the console is temporarily redirected to a StringWriter object so that we can get and test the output of the console.\n\nThe \".Trim()\" is used to remove any trailing newline characters which Console.WriteLine() appends to the string. If this is not removed, our test case would fail since \"Hello, World! \" is not equal to \"Hello, World!\". \n\nOn start, the main program should execute and print \"Hello, World!\" on the console. The Xunit test captures this console output and checks if it is as expected."},{"role":"user","content":"Please now remember the steps:\n\nThink step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.\nFirst lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\n\nThen you will output the content of each file including ALL code.\nEach file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that\n[FILENAME] is the lowercase file name including the file extension,\n[LANG] is the markup code block language for the code's language, and [CODE] is the code:\n\nSyntax:\n[FILENAME]\n```[LANG]\n[CODE]\n```\n\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.
