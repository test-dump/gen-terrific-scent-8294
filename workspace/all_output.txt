Both the main implementation and test implementation provided above are correct and should run without error for a "Hello World!" application in C#.

However, the Main method in the Program class is missing the args parameter which is usually present in C# console applications. This parameter allows the application to accept command-line arguments, although it's not used in this specific case.

Here's your main class adjusted:

Program.cs
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

And also, the test code was calling the Main method without arguments, we should adjust this to ensure compatibility,

ProgramTest.cs
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Xunit;

public class ProgramTest
{
    [Fact]
    public void HelloWorldOutputTest()
    {
        var sw = new StringWriter();
        Console.SetOut(sw);
        Program.Main(new string[0]);

        var result = sw.ToString().Trim();
        Assert.Equal("Hello, World!", result);
    }
}
```

Other than those tiny details, the code is perfectly fine and doesn't need any changes.
